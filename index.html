                <p>He who in 1943 had wanted to see Nazimuddin and Suhrawardy bite the dust now shares the same stretch
                    of earth with them. All three are buried, side by side, in the grounds of the Dhaka High Court. For
                    a while, the two of them were called Prime Minister of Pakistan. Fazlul Huq was not. But only he was
                    spoken of as the Royal Bengal Tiger.</p>
